# DjangoAppSearch

This was from a tutorial that I read. 
I found the template location not to be the same as the way I have learned. 
BaseApp/templates/
I adjusted the files to get the templates from a folder scheme set up in the
app and not a single folder in the BaseApp.
cities/templates/cities

This functionaly will be incorporated in to a large project I am working on.
