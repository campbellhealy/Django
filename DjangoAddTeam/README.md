# DjangoAddTeam
#### Add Teams to make a list

A simple APP to add teams to a database

Home page shows a list of teams added. If no teams in databae an additional message and button is shown.
The additional button performs the same task as the Add Team button, it is coloured different to highlight that no teams are added yet.

I have hard coded, three countries Malta, Scotland and Denmark into the database.
The countries are associated to a table of the soccer leagues for each of the countries.

Choosing a country will determine the leagues available to choose from when adding a team.

The options in the Add Form
Team name, Established Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Country (dropdown menu), League(Dropdown menu)
