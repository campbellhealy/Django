# Django-Blog

Following the youtube tutorial by Corey Schafer
I have created this blog website. 

Rather than copy and paste from his source code, I watched the videos and hand typed everything. Only if I was stuck did I refer to the source code to see where I went wrong.

Further to that I have made changes to the site that were more fitting to my eye.
Colour scheme
Buttons to restart writing a post, updating a post, updating a user profile
Buttons to cancel creation of / update of a post, change to a profile. Returning the user to the previous page in each instance.
Changed the pagnation from First, Last to << < > >>
